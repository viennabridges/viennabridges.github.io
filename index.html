<h2> Biography </h2>

	<p>	My name is Vienna Marie Bridges and I am a 27-year-old mother of two. Spencer Love, my daughter, is nearly seven. Atticus James, my son, is almost a year and a half old. Every day that I wake up, I hit the day head on so that I may build an amazing future for my family. I am a first generation graduate, from both high school, and college. I started with a two-year degree in Science so that I could become a nurse; however, I realized that I needed to go for something I have always had an extreme passionate for.

	<p> I have had a passion for writing, editing, and graphic design since I was a mere teen. I was the editor of my Jr./Sr. High School newspaper for years and this cultivated my passion for all of the aforementioned attributes. I have completed a plethora of compositions in the past decade, both for educational purposes, as well as in a professional setting. I have a varied skill-set, and a wide randge of knowledge of various aspects of business. I have sold advertising in a multitude of professional settings: In addition, I have completed an array of design work.

	<p> Ultimately, I intend on obtaining my Ph. D. in Technical Communications. Given the opportunity, I know I can become an invaluable member of your team. Professional, courteous, hard-working, and perseverant, are only a few of the qualities I encompass. With the ability to adapt to various work environments and job duties, if you chose me, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
