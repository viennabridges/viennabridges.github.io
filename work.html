<h3>Priest Lake Visitor's Guide</h3>
	<ul><li> 2006-2007; Mentored with Graphic Design artist and designed 32-page 60# spread. </li>
		<li> 2007-2008; All graphic design and production for 36-page 60# spread. </li>
		<li> 2008-2009; All of the 20K advertising sales and all graphic design/production for 40-page glossy matte spread. </li>
		<li> As you can tell, each subsequent year we increased the size by adding more advertising. In the last year of my employment, I single-handedly made the project's first profitable year and was able to add pages, and turn the document into a glossy magazine. I moved to Duluth, Minnesota, so I was unable to continue that project, but the real world knowledge obtained through that project was invaluable to my design repertoire.</li></ul>
